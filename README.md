Here is my project! Next year I will be studying translation studies, and I will be working on a re-translation (JP->FR) of the manga One Piece by Eiichiro Oda. 
In order to do this, I will have to analyze how characters talk, their speech habits etc.
Therefore, I wanted to know which characters appear the most (I couldn't find a database online that tracks the amount of speech bubbles for each character, therefore I will be working on characters who appear in most chapters since they are likely to be the most important) so that I know which ones are most significant to analyze (with, of course, other characters that appear rarely but have something that makes them interesting to analyze, but this is not the matter here).
This is why, in this project, I created a script that helps visualize the 20 characters who appear in most chapters in One Piece.
